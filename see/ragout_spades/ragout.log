[15:03:07] root: WARNING: Too few overlaps (4) between contigs were detected -- refine procedure will be useless. Possible reasons:

1. Some contigs output by assembler are missing
2. Contigs overlap not on a constant value (like k-mer for assemblers which use debruijn graph)
3. Contigs ends are trimmed/postprocessed
